Object oriented progaramming where we can create objects which have their own methods and member variables
class is a blueprint of a object created from it, means than an object of the class will have its own copy of methods and variables defined inside the class 
which determines the structure of the object

for example:
	class is like an species like human and eklavya is an object of it 
	here a human has some properties like name, address, gender etc      and also perform some functions(for objects we call methods) like walking, speaking, studying
	so when we create an object of an predefined in python we have to pass the proteries of the object to get it created 
	
	
definition of class starts with keyword 'class' and and then name of class that starts with capital letter then ():
__init__(self,parameters)           here __init__ function is used to construct the object with it instance variables
the values of the variables initialized before this function is same for every object of the class

a function inside a class is called method	 


when we call a method using an object, then we can use its variables in the method using keyword 'self' for example: self.a       refer to the member variable a of the calling object


one thing to note a method or function can have default values for its parameters which can be used when method do not receive any values on calling, if method or function is passed 
some values then the default values are overwritten by the passed values
